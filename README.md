# CRUDdy Products Inc.

A sample CRUD admin using Angular, Express (for REST API) & Angular Material components.

## Setup

Run `npm i` to install the needed packages.

## Development server

Run `npm start` (in the root) to start the dev server and Angular dev client. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

I'm using **concurrently** to run the server + client together.

The api is using the file based db **lowdb** to hold the data (it's a little limited on features - but super quick + simple).

## For the sake of the excerice and time - stuff NOT implemented
- Tests
- Production Deploy
